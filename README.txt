Step of this proxy.
We need to run more than 4 terminals for testing multiple clients.

1. make server in terminal 1.
	run server program
2. make middle in terminal 2.
	run proxy program
3. make client in terminal 3.
	run proxy
4. make client in terminal 4.
	run proxy

So, we can save all messages in the proxy.txt file.
